\chapter{My implementation}
\label{chp:fundamentals}
%************************************************

My main work in on audio implementation: i chose to use an open-source game written in C++ called Cube,
Cube is an 2D low-poly retro-style video-game with a low graphic resolution whose source code is available online. The definitions "low-poly" and "retro-style" are common used to describe the style of the graphic, witch is based on different scenes realized with "low-poly" objects, which are graphic components formed by a few geometric figures, which gives them an "angular" appearance. The "retro-style" is a type of graphic style recalls the graphics of the video games of the 80s and 90s, when the pixels were more visible and the resolution of the displays was much lower than the current one.
I chose to work on the sound design for Cube because the game is very simple, which allowed me to do a job faithful to my compositional intentions. In addition, this game was written for educational purposes: therefore, in addition to making the audio implementation intuitive, the source code is compatible with the most common audio implementation engines for video games. These softwares are called "middleware", and there are several:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item Wwise: the middleware i chose to use because is the most common and popular in the game-audio industry. It's developed by Audiokinetic
	\item Fabric: An audio middleware developed by Tazman-Audio
	\item Elias: An audio middleware that uses A.I.
\end{compactitem}



\section{Middleware}
\begin{flushright}
	\itshape
	Why was middleware needed? Well, music and sound designers and programmers developed middleware \\
	so that the designers and composer could gain more control over how their audio was used in games.\\
	Middleware is based on the idea that the video game is an interactive medium, \\
	so all audio elements within the game should be interactive as well. \\
	\medskip
	--- Steve Horowitz and Scott Looney, "The essential guide to game audio "
\end{flushright}

Middlewares are softwares that sits between the game engine and the audio engine, providing a set of tools and features to manage audio content and processing. Middleware typically provides a layer of abstraction between the game engine and the audio engine.
Middleware can perform a variety of tasks, such as audio playback, dynamic mixing, audio processing, sound effects, and music management. It can also handle the integration of external audio tools and libraries, such as plug-ins. For example, Wwise can communicate with Steinberg Nuendo. In Wwise can be also loaded the plug-ins produced by Izotope for audio processing
When a game is being developed, the middleware receives audio data from the game engine, processes it according to the developer's settings, and sends the soundbanks to the audio engine for playback.
A Soundbank is a collection of audio files, that are packaged together into a single file for efficient loading and playback during the game.
Soundbanks typically contain metadata that describes how the audio files should be played back in the game, such as volume, panning, and spatial positioning information. Them are usually created using middleware tools and are loaded by the game engine during runtime. By using soundbanks, is possible to enabling a more immersive and dynamic audio experience in the game.
But why should i use a middleware? Without it, it will be more expensive in terms of time and energies, and the final result will not be the same as it would be with using the tools of a middleware, because the it's a computing enviroment developed to allow the sound designer to set the sound in a certain way, starting from the EQ up to the spatialization. You can do a lot of operations in a smart way that would otherwise require a lot of lines of code

\section{Wwise}
For my implementation i chose to use Wwise. But how does it work?
	
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Integration: Game developers integrate the Wwise software development kit (SDK) into their game engine or application at the beginning of the project. Wwise usually comunicate with Unity and Unreal Engine. This allows the game engine to communicate with Wwise and utilize its audio features.
		
	\item Audio Asset Creation: Once the project has been created, the sound designers and the composers work on their music and sound with their own workflow on their favourite DAW (Digital audio workstation) and then load sounds into the Wwise hierarchy
		
	\item Project Setup: In Wwise, developers organize the imported audio assets into a project hierarchy.
		
	\item Sound Design and Mixing: Wwise provides a range of tools and features for sound design and mixing. Sound designers can define interactive behaviors and events, set up dynamic music systems, create spatial audio effects, and more.
		
	\item Integration with Game Events: Game events trigger specific audio actions within Wwise based on in-game events or conditions. For example, playing a gunshot sound effect when a player fires a weapon or triggering different music tracks based on the player's location or actions.
		
	\item Real-time Audio Processing: During gameplay, the game engine sends audio data requests to Wwise. Wwise processes these requests and provides the appropriate audio assets and information to the game engine, which then plays the audio in sync with the game's events and actions.
		
	\item Performance Optimization: Wwise offers various optimization features to ensure efficient and optimized audio processing. This includes streaming audio data, managing memory usage, and controlling resource usage based on gameplay priorities.
\end{compactitem}

To link a sound to a trigger, you need to create an event and put the sounds to play into it. The main section to work on to organize your work is the hierarchy. Here it is not only possible to order the types of events according to their purpose, but they can be grouped using functions that control certain playback parameters. 

\section{Random controllers}
Some of these events are grouped in differents containers. The containers are variations of the calling action of the differents events witch can trigger the sounds of the events in so many different ways, one of these is called Random Container: a set of audio events that are recalled randomly at each trigger. used for example for footsteps or jump sounds
Is also possible to control randomically some values through the game parameters.
Game Parameters in Wwise are numeric variables that can be used to control audio behavior during application interaction. They are dynamic parameters that allow you to adjust different sound aspects in real time, such as volume, panning, transitions and more. Game Parameters offer a flexible way to create responsive and personalized audio interactions, also in randomic way. Is possible give to a game parameters a range of values ​​in which to recall a parameter at each trigger, such as the volume, for example in a range from -12 and -3dB, or the cutoff frequency of a lowpass filter, for example from 200 to 1000 Hz.

\section{Dynamic controllers}
Some of these events are modulated by RTPC (Real-Time Parameter Control). It's a system that allows you to control the sound parameters in real time while playing the game.
RTPC allows to change the values ​​of a parameter, such as the volume, the pitch or the cutoff frequency of a filter, dynamically and based on events or situations that appeares in the game. For example, RTPC could be used to increase the volume of the sound when the player approaches a noise source, or to increase the pitch (so the playback speed) of the heartbeat sound based on the ammount of the healt of the character. In this way, a more immersive and realistic sound experience can be created for the player.

\begin{code}
\documentclass[\meta{\dots\unkern}]{scrreprt} % or scrbook or scrartcl

\usepackage[\meta{\dots\unkern}]{classicthesis}
\usepackage{arsclassica}

\begin{document}
\dots
\end{document}
\end{code}

For example, this document has been produced with the following code:
\begin{code}
\documentclass[a4paper,twoside,openright,titlepage,
               headinclude,footinclude,BCOR5mm,
               numbers=noenddot,cleardoublepage=empty,
               tablecaptionabove]{scrreprt}

\usepackage{\meta{\dots\unkern}}
\usepackage{subfig}
\usepackage[eulerchapternumbers,subfig,beramono,eulermath,pdfspacing]%
           {classicthesis}
\usepackage{arsclassica}

\begin{document}
\dots
\end{document}
\end{code}

It is recommended to use the \optname{beramono} and \optname{eulerchapternumbers} options together with \arsclassica.



\section{Style}

The typographical style achieved with \arsclassica{} differs from \classicthesis{} in the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item use of Iwona font, by Janusz Nowacki, for the sectioning unit titles (chapters, sections, subsections, sub-subsections, paragraphs and subparagraphs), for the description list labels, the headlines and the caption labels (\classicthesis{} doesn't use any sans serif font);
\item customized chapter numbers;
\item semi-transparent headlines; the headlines are separated from the page number by a small rule;
\item caption labels in boldface (\classicthesis{} doesn't use any boldface font);
\item itemize lists with semi-transparent bullets.
\end{itemize}

\arsclassica{} is designed  to provide a ready-to-use typographical style: for this reason it has no loading options and it is \emph{not} configurable or customizable in any way. If you change the previous settings, you'll risk to destroy the balance of the style, so it is \emph{highly recommended} to keep them unchanged.

One of the principles of \LaTeX{} is that it allows the author to take no interest in the typographical questions, permitting him to focus only on the structure and the contents of his document. This fact should always be kept in mind: using a style written by others, the user accepts all the typographical settings chosen for him by the author of the style, and he isn't forced to study typography to fine-tune the layout of his publications. This is the case of \arsclassica{} too: if you change its settings, you'll deny this philosophy and, consequently, you'll have to study (a lot of) typography to achieve acceptable results.

The style achieved with \arsclassica{} is \emph{not} therefore configurable or customizable. The typographical style is very personal: if you like this package and find attractive the idea to take no interest in the problem of the style definition, then you'll use \arsclassica{} with satisfaction; otherwise, if you have different needs or you aren't satisfied with the layout of the package, then you should try other classes or packages, even building your own style.



\section{Important}

To write a document according to the \arsclassica{} style, you have to follow some very simple rules.
\begin{itemize}
\item Don't change \emph{for any reason} the \arsclassica{} settings (fonts, text body size, colors, \dots).
\item The sectioning unit titles (chapters, section, subsections, \dots) have to be \emph{one line long}, possibly in \emph{plain text} (no symbols, formulas or code fragments). If you have titles longer than one line, try and rephrase them: you can almost always do it.
\item In the table of contents and in the list of tables and figures, captions have to be \emph{one line long}, possibly in \emph{plain text}. Use the optional argument of sectioning commands and of \cmdname{caption}, if necessary.
\item Don't use \optname{tocaligned} and \optname{dottedtoc} options of \classicthesis: the default table of contents does the job very well (see the documentation of \classicthesis{} for a nice discussion of this point).
\item Don't use vertical or double rules in your tables (see the documentation of \pkgname{booktabs}).
\item Use footnotes and margin notes very sparingly.
\item If your document includes graphs and plots, draw them using \LaTeX{} (by \pkgname{Ti\emph{k}Z} and \pkgname{pgfplots}, for example) and not an external software. This is the only way to get the best typographical outcome.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Some formulas}

Una formula in linea viene incorporata nel testo: $\lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$, per esempio. Come si osserva, \LaTeX{} fa \emph{il possibile} per comprimerla e modificare il meno possibile l'interlinea nel capoverso che la contiene.
Una formula in display viene invece composta da \LaTeX{} su linee a parte, separate dal contesto con adeguati spazi bianchi per metterla in mostra e farla risaltare sulla pagina.
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2}= \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\end{equation}
Come si osserva, ora la formula risulta centrata, non compressa, e tutti i suoi elementi occupano il giusto spazio con un risultato finale di grande respiro.
